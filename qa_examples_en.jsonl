{"context": "However, this market system undoubtedly perpetuates the political structure of the traditional imperial colonial system, resulting in a number of colonies and semi-colonies.", "question": "What are the consequences of the formation of the world market system?", "answer": "The formation of the world market system perpetuates the political structure of the traditional imperial colonial system, resulting in a number of colonies and semi-colonies. This political structure allows developed or strong countries to economically exploit and control underdeveloped or weak countries, leading to global economic inequality and injustice. Colonies and semi-colonies are often forced to rely on the export of primary products and import of manufactured goods, making their economies vulnerable to fluctuations in international market prices, thus limiting their potential for economic development. Additionally, this system may lead to unfair distribution of resources, environmental destruction, as well as social and cultural conflicts. Although the modern world market has undergone changes, its historical legacy issues continue to have a global impact."}

{"context": "So, the probability evidence is especially important in proving standards.", "question": "Why is probability evidence especially important in proving standards?", "answer": "Because the persuasiveness and authenticity of evidence are often related to the frequency or probability of occurrence, probability evidence can help evaluate the reliability of an argument. In law, science, and other fields where determining the truth or responsibility is necessary, the credibility of evidence is a key factor in determining conclusions. Probability evidence can quantify this credibility, assess the likelihood of an event occurring through statistical analysis and probability calculation, and thereby plays an important role in proving standards. It makes the decision-making process more objective and quantitative, reduces the impact of subjective biases, and helps to more fairly evaluate facts and determine the truth."}
